# Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis of Human Cerebellum (10x Visium)
## Overview

In this project, I analyze 10x Genomics Visium spatial transcriptomics data from human cerebellum tissue to study how gene expression varies across space. The goal is to understand whether transcriptional patterns alone can recover meaningful tissue organization and to identify genes that define spatial regions within the cerebellum.

This project focuses on combining careful quality control, expression-based clustering, and spatial validation to draw biologically interpretable conclusions from spatial transcriptomics data.
